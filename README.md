# Book Search

## Description
 - This is an application that uses Google's API to search for books and returns a list of book details such as the title, author, and brief description. Users can create an account, which is stored in a MongoDB database, and save books to their account, which they can remove later. The project's aim was to practice setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to retrieve and modify data instead of the traditional RESTful API. Additionally, the authentication middleware was adapted to function in a GraphQL API context. Finally, an Apollo Provider was created to enable requests to communicate with an Apollo Server.

## Usage
 - This is a book search application that utilizes Google's API to fetch book details such as title, author, and a short description. The app offers users the ability to register an account, which is then saved in a MongoDB database. Users can then save books to their account and remove them whenever they want. The project's primary objective was to practice building an Apollo Server that can handle GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data instead of using the traditional RESTful API. Additionally, the existing authentication middleware was adapted to function seamlessly in a GraphQL API context. An Apollo Provider was also created to enable requests to communicate with an Apollo Server.
